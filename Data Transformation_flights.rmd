This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r set up, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Install a New Package

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('nycflights13')
```

## Load Packages

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

## Some useful functions

### 'unique'

Returns the unique values of a variable.

```{r}
unique(flights$carrier)
```

### 'sort'

Order the values of a variable.

```{r}
sort(unique(flights$carrier))
```

### %in%

Check for membership in a vector.

```{r}
filter(flights, dep_time %in% c(517, 533))
```

1. Check out sum(), max(), min(), and length().

```{r}
sum(flights$day)
```

```{r}
max(flights$day)
```

```{r}
min(flights$day)
```

```{r}
length(flights$day)
```

## Missing data

Missing data in R is represented as 'NA'; the data is not available. Data can be missing for a variety of reasons. Sometimes the data was just never there. Other times it could be the result of an error.

One problem with NA’s is that they propagate.

### Operations with 'NA'

If we have missing data and try to do basic operations, the result will be 'NA'. Here are some examples.

```{r}
NA > 5
```

```{r}
NA == 10
```

```{r}
NA + 10
```

```{r}
NA / 2
```

```{r}
NA == NA
```

The last comparison may be easier to understand if it is stated as follows:

```{r}
x <- NA  # Let x represent Joseph's age
y <- NA  # Let y represent Sally's age
x == y   # determine if Joseph's age equals Sally's age
```

### Is a value NA?

A useful function for determining if a variable is 'NA' is

```{r}
is.na(x)
```

We can also use this to check each element of a vector.

```{r}
z <- c(1, 3, NA, 4, NA, 5)
is.na(z)
```

It is also sometimes useful to use the 'NOT' operator '!' in conjunction with 'is.na()'. '!TRUE = FALSE' and '!FALSE = TRUE'.

```{r}
!is.na(z)
```

Since, under the hood, 'TRUE = 1' and 'FALSE = 0', this provides an easy way of counting NA’s:

```{r}
sum(is.na(z))
```

Or we could use it to get the proportion of missing values in a vector (or data frame column).

```{r}
prop_na <- sum(is.na(z))/length(z)
prop_na
```

'summary' will also give you counts of missing values.

2. Use 'summary' to see if the 'flights' data frame contains any missing values.

```{r}
summary(flights)
```

### Removing NA’s

Many functions in R allow you to explicitly remove missing data before carrying out their operations.

Compare

```{r}
sum(z)
```

to the output of

```{r}
sum(z, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Now let’s get back to practicing with the 'dplyr' verbs. Here we’ll start answering specific questions using the 'filter' function.

## Section 5.2.4 Exercises

3. Find all flights that had an arrival delay of two or more hours

```{r}
flights %>% filter(arr_delay >= 120)
```

4. Find all flights that flew to Houston (IAH or HOU).

```{r}
flights %>% filter(dest == 'IAH' | dest == 'HOU')
```
OR we can also use:

```{r}
flights %>% filter(dest %in% c('IAH', 'HOU'))
```

5. Find all flights that were operated by United, American, or Delta.

Get airline codes

```{r}
airlines
```

```{r}
flights %>% filter(carrier %in% c('UA', 'AA', 'DL'))
```

6. Find all flights that departed in summer (July, August, and September).

```{r}
flights %>% filter(month %in% c(7, 8, 9))
```
Check that results have only these values for month.

```{r}
summer_flights <- flights %>% filter(month %in% c(7, 8, 9))
unique(summer_flights$month)
```

7. Find all flights that arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late.

```{r}
flights %>% filter(arr_delay > 120 &  dep_delay <= 0)
```

8. Find all flights that were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight.

```{r}
flights %>% filter(dep_delay >= 60 &  (dep_delay - arr_delay) > 30)
```

9. Find all flights that departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive).

```{r}
max(flights$dep_time, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
min(flights$dep_time, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
flights %>% filter(dep_time <= 600 |  dep_time == 2400)
```

10. How many flights have a missing 'dep_time'? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

```{r}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
```

```{r}
summary(flights)
```

-> The rows with missing data are most likely canceled flights.
